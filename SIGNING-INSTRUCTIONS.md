# AAB File Signing Instructions

## The Problem
Google Play Console shows "All uploaded bundles must be signed" because you have Play App Signing enabled with an upload key. You need to sign the unsigned .aab file from PWABuilder with your upload key before uploading.

## Quick Solution Steps

### Step 1: Download Required Files
From your Replit project, download these files to your computer:
- `android/app/flashtastic-keystore.jks` (your signing key)
- `sign-aab-windows.bat` (the signing script)

### Step 2: Place Files Together
Put both files in the same folder on your computer (like Desktop or Downloads)

### Step 3: Run the Signing Script
1. Double-click `sign-aab-windows.bat`
2. When prompted, drag and drop your unsigned .aab file from PWABuilder
3. Press Enter
4. The script will create a signed version: `your-file-signed.aab`

### Step 4: Upload to Google Play
Upload the **signed** .aab file to Google Play Console. The package name error should be resolved.

## Manual Alternative (if script doesn't work)
If you have Android Studio installed, you can sign manually:

1. Open Android Studio
2. Go to Build → Generate Signed Bundle/APK
3. Choose "Android App Bundle"
4. Use your `flashtastic-keystore.jks` file
5. Key alias: `flashtastic`
6. Passwords: `flashtastic123`

## Expected Results
- Package name: `com.flashkademy.app` ✓
- Properly signed with your upload key ✓
- Google Play Console accepts the bundle ✓
- Package name mismatch error resolved ✓

The key insight is that Google Play Console already has app signing configured (as shown in your screenshot), so you need to sign with your upload key, not rely on Google to sign an unsigned bundle.
