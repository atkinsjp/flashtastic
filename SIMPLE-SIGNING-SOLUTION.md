# Simple AAB Signing Solution

## The Issue
Java command line setup is complex on Windows. Here's the simplest solution:

## Option 1: Android Studio Signing (Recommended)

### Download Files from Replit:
1. Right-click and download: `android/app/flashtastic-keystore.jks`
2. Download your entire project folder or just the `android` folder

### Sign with Android Studio:
1. **Install Android Studio** from https://developer.android.com/studio
2. **Open Project**: File → Open → select your `android` folder
3. **Build Signed Bundle**:
   - Build → Generate Signed Bundle/APK
   - Choose "Android App Bundle"
   - Keystore path: Browse to `flashtastic-keystore.jks`
   - Key store password: `flashtastic123`
   - Key alias: `flashtastic`
   - Key password: `flashtastic123`
4. **Find Output**: `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

## Option 2: Use Existing Keystore with PWABuilder

Try PWABuilder again but this time:
1. Select "Use mine" for signing key
2. Upload your `flashtastic-keystore.jks` file
3. Enter the credentials:
   - Keystore password: `flashtastic123`
   - Key alias: `flashtastic`
   - Key password: `flashtastic123`

## Expected Result
Either method creates a signed .aab file with:
- Package name: `com.flashkademy.app`
- Proper Google Play Console compatibility
- Resolution of the package name mismatch error

## Quick Test
After signing, you can verify the package name by uploading to Google Play Console. The error about package name mismatch should be resolved.

The Android Studio method is most reliable since it doesn't depend on Windows command line Java setup.
