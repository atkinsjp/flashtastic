# Windows Android Studio Setup for FlashTastic

## Current Issue
You ran `npm fund` from the wrong directory. You need to navigate to your FlashTastic project folder first.

## Correct Steps for Windows

### 1. Navigate to Your Project
```powershell
# Navigate to where you downloaded/cloned FlashTastic
cd C:\path\to\your\flashtastic\project

# Verify you're in the right place - you should see these files:
dir
# Should show: android/, client/, server/, package.json, capacitor.config.ts
```

### 2. Open Android Studio from Project Root
```powershell
# From your FlashTastic project folder:
npx cap open android
```

This will:
- Open Android Studio
- Load your FlashTastic Android project
- Show the project structure in Android Studio

### 3. Sign the Bundle in Android Studio

Once Android Studio opens with your project:

1. **Build Menu** → **Generate Signed Bundle/APK**
2. Select **Android App Bundle** (not APK)
3. Click **Next**
4. Click **Create new...** to create keystore
5. Fill keystore details:
   - **Key store path**: `C:\Users\James\flashtastic-keystore.jks`
   - **Password**: Create strong password (save it!)
   - **Key alias**: `flashtastic-key`
   - **Certificate info**: Your name, organization, etc.
6. Click **OK** then **Next**
7. Select **release** build variant
8. Click **Finish**

### 4. Find Your Signed Bundle
After building, find your signed bundle at:
```
android\app\release\app-release.aab
```

## If Android Studio Won't Open

### Install Android Studio (if not installed)
1. Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
2. Install with default settings
3. Open Android Studio
4. Configure SDK (follow setup wizard)

### Alternative: Manual Project Open
1. Open Android Studio
2. **File** → **Open**
3. Navigate to your FlashTastic project
4. Select the `android` folder
5. Click **OK**

## Troubleshooting

### Can't find your project?
The FlashTastic project should be in:
- Downloads folder if you downloaded it
- Desktop if you saved it there
- Replit workspace if you're using Replit

### Project structure should look like:
```
FlashTastic/
├── android/          ← This is what you open in Android Studio
├── client/
├── server/
├── package.json
└── capacitor.config.ts
```

## Next Steps After Signing
1. Upload the `.aab` file to Google Play Console
2. Complete store listing
3. Submit for review
4. Launch within 1-3 days!

Your FlashTastic app is ready - you just need to sign it from the correct project directory.
