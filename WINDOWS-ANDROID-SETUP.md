# Windows Android Studio Setup - Alternative Method

## If No Gradle Panel Appears

The issue is likely that Android Studio didn't recognize the project structure. Let's fix this:

### Method 1: Open the Android Folder Directly
1. **Close Android Studio completely**
2. **Navigate to**: `C:\Users\James\FlashTastic\FlashTastic\android`
3. **Right-click** on the `android` folder
4. **Open with Android Studio** (or drag the `android` folder into Android Studio)

This opens just the Android part of your project, which Android Studio will recognize.

### Method 2: Import Project
1. In Android Studio: **File** → **Open**
2. Navigate to: `C:\Users\James\FlashTastic\FlashTastic\android`
3. Select the **android** folder (not the main FlashTastic folder)
4. Click **OK**

### Method 3: Check Project Structure
If you're in the main FlashTastic folder, Android Studio sees it as a Node.js project, not Android.

You need to open the **android subfolder specifically**.

### What Should Happen
Once you open the android folder correctly:
- You'll see **app**, **gradle**, **build.gradle** files
- **Gradle panel** will appear on the right
- **Build** menu will have Android options
- Sync will happen automatically

### Then Follow Normal Steps
1. Wait for **Gradle sync** to complete
2. **Build** → **Make Project** 
3. **Build** → **Generate Signed Bundle/APK**

## Quick Fix Command
Try this in PowerShell:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\James\FlashTastic\FlashTastic\android"
# Then open Android Studio from this folder
```

The key is opening the `android` subfolder, not the main project folder!
