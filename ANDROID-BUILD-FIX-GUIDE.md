# ðŸ”§ Android Build Fix - AGP Version Alignment

## Issue Resolved
The "No matching variant" error was caused by AGP version mismatch:
- Android Studio expected: AGP 8.3.2
- Project was configured for: AGP 8.7.2

## âœ… Configuration Now Fixed
- **AGP Version**: 8.3.2 (all modules aligned)
- **Gradle Version**: 8.4 (compatible with AGP 8.3.2)
- **Java Version**: Let Android Studio manage (recommended)

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Android Studio

### 1. Clean Start
```bash
cd android
rm -rf .gradle .idea
```

### 2. Open in Android Studio
1. Launch Android Studio
2. Open the `android` folder (not root project)
3. Wait for automatic sync (should work now)
4. Accept any SDK license prompts

### 3. Verify Success
After sync completes, check:
- Build menu shows "Generate Signed Bundle / APK"
- Project structure shows "app" module
- No version conflict errors in sync log

### 4. Build Release Bundle
1. Build â†’ Generate Signed Bundle / APK
2. Choose "Android App Bundle"
3. Create/select keystore
4. Build release bundle

## ðŸ“‹ Current Build Configuration
