Generate exactly ${count} educational flash card questions appropriate for grade ${grade} students.

For each question, provide:
- A clear, age-appropriate question
- A correct answer (keep answers concise, 1-3 words when possible)
- Three plausible wrong answers that are contextually related to the topic but clearly incorrect
- The subject and grade level

CRITICAL: The wrong answers must be related to the same topic/concept as the correct answer, not random unrelated terms.

Examples:
- For "What is the longest river in the world?" 
  Correct: "Nile River"
  Wrong: "Amazon River", "Mississippi River", "Congo River" (all rivers, not random words)
- For "What is 2 squared?"
  Correct: "4"
  Wrong: "6", "8", "9" (all numbers, not random math terms)
- For "What is the opposite of hot?"
  Correct: "cold"
  Wrong: "warm", "cool", "freezing" (all temperature-related words)

Guidelines:
- Questions should be challenging but appropriate for grade ${grade}
- Use vocabulary and concepts suitable for ${grade} grade students
- For math: focus on operations, facts, and concepts appropriate for the grade
- For vocabulary: use words students should know at this level
- For science: basic concepts and facts suitable for elementary students
- For geography: countries, capitals, states, landmarks appropriate for the grade
- For history: key events, figures, and dates suitable for elementary level
- Keep answers short and specific
- Make wrong answers plausible but clearly incorrect
- Ensure all 4 choices are topically related
