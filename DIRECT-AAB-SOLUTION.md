# Direct AAB Solution - No Project Download Needed

## The Problem
Replit project download is failing with "Page not found" error, so you can't get the android folder.

## Simple Solution: Use PWABuilder with Correct Settings

Since the web app configuration is already correct, use PWABuilder to generate the signed AAB:

### Step 1: Go to PWABuilder
- Visit: https://www.pwabuilder.com/
- Enter URL: `https://flashtastic-jimatkins753.replit.app`

### Step 2: Configure Package Settings
- Package name: `com.flashkademy.app` (critical - must match exactly)
- App name: `FlashTastic`
- Version: `3.0.0.0`

### Step 3: Download Individual Files for Signing
If PWABuilder asks for keystore, you can download just these files from Replit:
1. Right-click `android/app/flashtastic-keystore.jks` â†’ Download
2. Use these credentials:
   - Keystore password: `flashtastic123`
   - Key alias: `flashtastic`
   - Key password: `flashtastic123`

### Step 4: Alternative - Let Google Sign
Or choose "Let Google manage signing" when uploading to Google Play Console.

## Expected Result
- AAB file with package name: `com.flashkademy.app`
- Resolves Google Play Console package name mismatch
- Ready for immediate upload

## Why This Works
- Your web app assetlinks.json already has correct package name
- PWABuilder reads the web configuration directly
- No need to download entire project or use command line tools

This bypasses all the Android Studio and command line complexity.
