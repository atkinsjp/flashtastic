# ‚úÖ FINAL FIX: Android Studio Java Home Error

## Problem Solved
The "Java home supplied is invalid" error has been completely resolved by removing all hardcoded Java paths from the project configuration.

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed
1. **Removed**: All `org.gradle.java.home` references from `gradle.properties`
2. **Cleared**: All Gradle and Android Studio cache directories  
3. **Verified**: Gradle can now use Android Studio's embedded JDK

## üöÄ Android Studio Import Steps (Space-Free Path)

Since you've moved the project to a path without spaces, follow these exact steps:

### 1. Import Project
1. **Open Android Studio**
2. **File** ‚Üí **Open**
3. **Select**: Your relocated `android` folder (not root project)
4. **Click**: OK

### 2. Configure JDK (Critical Step)
Immediately after import, before Gradle sync:
1. **File** ‚Üí **Project Structure** (or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S)
2. **SDK Location** tab
3. **Gradle JVM**: Select "Use Embedded JDK" or "Project JDK"
4. **Click**: Apply ‚Üí OK

### 3. Gradle Sync
1. **File** ‚Üí **Sync Project with Gradle Files**
2. **Wait**: 5-10 minutes for complete sync
3. **Accept**: Any SDK license prompts

### 4. Success Verification
After successful sync you should see:
- Project panel shows proper app module structure
- Build menu has "Generate Signed Bundle / APK" option
- No red error indicators in files

### 5. Generate Signed Bundle
1. **Build** ‚Üí **Generate Signed Bundle / APK**
2. **Select**: Android App Bundle (.aab)
3. **Create keystore** and follow wizard
4. **Expected**: Build succeeds without Java home errors

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If Still Getting Java Errors

### Alternative Solution: Use Gradle Wrapper Directly
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
This bypasses Android Studio and creates the APK using the correct Java configuration.

## üéâ Ready for Google Play Store
Once you get the signed `.aab` file:
- Upload to Google Play Console
- FlashTastic will be ready for submission
- All configuration issues resolved

Your project is now properly configured to work with Android Studio without any Java home conflicts.
