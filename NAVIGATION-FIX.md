# PowerShell Navigation Fix

## Current Issue
You're in `C:\Users\James>` but need to be inside your downloaded android folder.

## Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Find Your Downloaded Android Folder
Check these common locations:
```powershell
# Check Downloads folder
cd "C:\Users\James\Downloads"
dir

# Look for android folder or extracted project
# It might be named something like:
# - android
# - flashtastic-main\android
# - your-project-name\android
```

### 2. Navigate to Android Folder
Once you find it, navigate there:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\James\Downloads\android"
# or wherever your android folder is located
```

### 3. Verify You're in the Right Place
Check for gradlew.bat:
```powershell
dir gradlew.bat
```
You should see: `gradlew.bat`

### 4. Build the Bundle
Now run:
```powershell
.\gradlew.bat bundleRelease
```

## Alternative: Use Full Path
If you know where the android folder is, you can run directly:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\James\Downloads\your-project\android"
.\gradlew.bat bundleRelease
```

## Expected Success
After successful build, find your signed AAB at:
`app\build\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab`
