# Download FlashTastic from Replit (Updated Interface)

## Method 1: From the Files Panel

1. **Open your FlashTastic Replit workspace**
2. **Look at the Files panel** (left sidebar)
3. **Right-click on the root folder** (the top-level folder icon)
4. Select **"Download as ZIP"** from the context menu

## Method 2: From the Shell/Console

1. **Open Shell/Console** in your Replit workspace
2. Run this command to create a zip:
```bash
zip -r flashtastic.zip . -x "node_modules/*" ".git/*"
```
3. **Download the zip file** from the Files panel

## Method 3: Git Clone Method

If download isn't available, you can clone via Git:

1. **Make your Replit public** (temporarily)
2. **Get the Git URL** from your Replit
3. **On your Windows computer**, run:
```powershell
git clone https://replit.com/@yourusername/flashtastic.git
cd flashtastic
```

## Method 4: Alternative Download Locations

Look for download options in these places:

### A. Main Menu (Hamburger Menu)
- Click the **â‰¡** (hamburger menu) at top-left
- Look for **"Download"** or **"Export"** option

### B. File Menu
- If there's a **File** menu, check for **"Download as ZIP"**

### C. Settings/Tools
- Check **Settings** or **Tools** menu for export options

## What to Do After Download

1. **Extract the ZIP file** to: `C:\Users\James\FlashTastic`
2. **Open PowerShell** and navigate:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\James\FlashTastic
```
3. **Verify project structure**:
```powershell
dir
```
Should show: `android/`, `client/`, `server/`, `package.json`

4. **Open Android Studio**:
```powershell
npx cap open android
```

## If You Still Can't Find Download

**Alternative: Use Replit's built-in mobile deployment**

Replit may have mobile deployment features. Check if there's:
- A **"Deploy"** button
- **"Mobile"** options in the interface
- **"Capacitor"** or **"Android"** deployment options

## Backup Plan: Manual File Copy

If all else fails:
1. **Select all files** in Replit Files panel
2. **Copy and paste** into a local folder
3. **Recreate the project structure** manually

The key is getting your FlashTastic code onto your local Windows machine so you can use Android Studio to create the signed bundle for Google Play Store.
