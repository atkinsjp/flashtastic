# FlashKademy Mobile App Conversion Guide

## Overview
This guide walks through converting FlashKademy from a PWA to native iOS and Android apps using Capacitor.

## Prerequisites Completed âœ…
- Capacitor dependencies installed
- Configuration file created
- Build process optimized for mobile

## Step 1: Initialize Capacitor Project

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Initialize Capacitor
npx cap init FlashKademy com.flashkademy.app

# Add iOS and Android platforms
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
```

## Step 2: Build the Web App

```bash
# Build the production version
npm run build

# Sync the web build to native platforms
npx cap sync
```

## Step 3: Configure Mobile-Specific Features

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/App/App.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Configure app icons and launch screens
3. Set deployment target to iOS 13.0+
4. Configure app permissions in `Info.plist`

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/` folder in Android Studio
2. Configure app icons and splash screens
3. Set minimum SDK version to API 22 (Android 5.1)
4. Configure permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`

## Step 4: Mobile-Specific Optimizations

### App Icons
- iOS: 1024x1024px for App Store, multiple sizes for device
- Android: 512x512px for Play Store, adaptive icons recommended

### Splash Screens
- Configure in `capacitor.config.ts`
- iOS: Various sizes for different devices
- Android: 9-patch images or vector drawables

### Performance
- Enable hardware acceleration
- Optimize bundle size
- Configure proper caching
- Test on actual devices

## Step 5: Test on Devices

```bash
# iOS (requires Mac + Xcode)
npx cap run ios

# Android (requires Android Studio)
npx cap run android
```

## Step 6: Build for Production

### iOS App Store Build
```bash
npx cap build ios
# Then use Xcode to archive and upload to App Store Connect
```

### Android Play Store Build
```bash
npx cap build android --prod
# Generate signed APK/AAB in Android Studio
```

## Mobile App Features to Test

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Flash card interactions work smoothly
- [ ] 3D avatars display correctly
- [ ] Competition features function properly
- [ ] Parent dashboard loads completely
- [ ] Offline functionality works
- [ ] Data sync between sessions

### Mobile-Specific Features
- [ ] Touch gestures (swipe, tap, pinch)
- [ ] Keyboard handling
- [ ] Screen rotation support
- [ ] Background app behavior
- [ ] Push notifications (if implemented)
- [ ] Deep linking (if needed)

### Performance Checks
- [ ] App startup time < 3 seconds
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable
- [ ] Battery consumption is acceptable
- [ ] Works on low-end devices

## Next Steps After Conversion

1. **Beta Testing**: Test with real families on TestFlight (iOS) and Internal Testing (Android)
2. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize any slow areas
3. **App Store Compliance**: Ensure all guidelines are met
4. **Marketing Assets**: Create screenshots, videos, and store descriptions
5. **Launch Strategy**: Coordinate launch across both platforms

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures
- Check Node.js version compatibility
- Clear Capacitor cache: `npx cap clean`
- Verify all dependencies are installed

### Runtime Issues
- Test web version first to isolate Capacitor issues
- Check browser console for errors
- Use device debugging tools

### Performance Problems
- Enable production builds
- Optimize images and assets
- Reduce bundle size
- Test on actual devices, not just simulators
