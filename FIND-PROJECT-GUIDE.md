# How to Find Your FlashTastic Project

## Option 1: You're Working on Replit (Most Likely)

If you're building FlashTastic on Replit, you need to download it to your computer first:

### Download from Replit:
1. In your Replit workspace, click the three dots menu (â‹®)
2. Select **Download as zip**
3. Save to your Downloads folder
4. Extract the zip file to a folder like `C:\Users\James\FlashTastic`

### Then navigate to it:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\James\Downloads\FlashTastic
# or wherever you extracted it
```

## Option 2: You Cloned from GitHub

If you cloned the project, check common locations:

### Check Desktop:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\James\Desktop
dir | findstr FlashTastic
```

### Check Documents:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\James\Documents
dir | findstr FlashTastic
```

### Check Downloads:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\James\Downloads
dir | findstr FlashTastic
```

## Option 3: Search Your Entire Computer

Use Windows search:
1. Press **Windows key + S**
2. Type "FlashTastic"
3. Look for a folder with that name
4. Note the full path

Or use PowerShell to search:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Name "*FlashTastic*" -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## Verify You Found the Right Project

Once you find a FlashTastic folder, check it contains:
```powershell
cd path\to\your\FlashTastic
dir
```

You should see:
- `android/` folder
- `client/` folder  
- `server/` folder
- `package.json` file
- `capacitor.config.ts` file

## If You Can't Find It

You might be working directly on Replit. In that case:

1. **Download your project from Replit first**
2. Extract to your computer
3. Then open Android Studio from that location

## Next Steps Once Found

```powershell
# Navigate to your project
cd path\to\your\FlashTastic

# Open Android Studio
npx cap open android
```

This will open Android Studio with your FlashTastic project ready for signing.
